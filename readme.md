A small 2D C++ Game Framework, made for educational purposes.

Disclaimer: 80% of this codebase was copied from https://github.com/NoelFB/blah to learn CPP and OpenGL. That repo great place to start if you already know the basics and want to learn how to put together an OpenGL abstraction + spritebatcher + shader/material system, etc.(thanks @NoelFB for making this public) 

The remaining 20% are deviations I took to learn different libraries or just because I wanted to structure
the code differently.

WIP

It includes a demo project in the sandbox directory (a simple Flappy Bird clone):
